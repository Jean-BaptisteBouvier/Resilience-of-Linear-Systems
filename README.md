This project contains all the MATLAB code for the simulations shown in the paper.
Requires the CORA toolbox available on MATLAB to compute the zonotopes.

The ADMIRE simulation is run with amire_reachability.m
The temperature simulation is run with temperature.m
The functions time_optimal_Eaton.m and time_optimal_Sakawa.m compute the minimal reachability times for linear systems. They are used in temperature.m
